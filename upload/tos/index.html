    <p>Last Updated: April 19, 2024</p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("TOS") carefully before using our file upload system.</p>
    <p>By accessing or using the file upload system, you agree to be bound by these TOS. If you disagree with any part
        of the terms, then you may not access the service.</p>

    <h2>1. Individual Use Only</h2>

    Our file upload system is designed for individual users to securely share files for personal and legitimate
    purposes. Commercial or advertising-related activities are not permitted unless prior authorization is obtained from
    us.

    <p>If we suspect that content uploaded to our platform is intended for commercial or advertising purposes rather
        than individual use, we reserve the right to take appropriate action, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul class="dotted-list">
        <li>Blocking the IP address associated with the upload.</li>
        <li>Removing the content from our system.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Additionally, we may initiate an investigation into the uploaded content. As part of this investigation, we may
        review the file being sent and its intended use. Based on our findings, we may take one of the following
        actions:</p>
    <ul class="dotted-list">
        <li>Blocking the IP address and removing the file.</li>
        <li>Blocking the IP address without removing the file.</li>
        <li>Removing the file without blocking the IP address.</li>
        <li>Taking no action if the content is deemed to comply with our guidelines.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>It is important for users to ensure that the content they upload is for personal use and complies with our terms
        of service. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding in maintaining a fair and secure environment for
        all users.</p>

        <li>Any content that violates local, state, national, or international laws or regulations.</li>

            copyrights, trademarks, and patents.</li>

            malware, viruses, or other harmful software.</li>
        <li>Content that is defamatory, obscene, pornographic, or otherwise offensive or inappropriate.</li>
        <li>Files that contain sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, or
            other confidential data, without proper authorization.</li>

        systems, network, or other users' devices. This includes, but is not limited to, files containing malicious
        code, viruses, or other harmful software.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to remove any content that violates these guidelines and to take appropriate action,
        including suspending or terminating access to our services, in cases of repeated violations. Additionally, we
        may report illegal activities to the relevant authorities as required by law.</p>

        legal purposes, including but not limited to investigating and preventing unauthorized access, abuse, or illegal
        activities.</p>
    <p>Additionally, to maintain the integrity of our system, IP addresses may be retained for a period of up to one
        year after the respective file has been removed from our servers. This retention period allows us to address any
        potential legal issues or disputes that may arise regarding uploaded content.</p>
    <p>Rest assured that your IP address is safe with us and will not be disclosed to the public or law enforcement
        authorities unless required by a valid court order or legal process. We are committed to protecting the privacy
        and security of our users' information.</p>
