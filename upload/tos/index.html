    <p>Last Updated: April 19, 2024</p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("TOS") carefully before using our file upload system (https://perox.dev/upload/) operated by Perox.dev ("EGWMIADG", “us”, “we”, or “our”).</p>
    <p>By accessing or using the file upload system, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the service. Please be aware that the file upload system is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding the accuracy, reliability, or availability of the service.</p>
    <p>We disclaim any responsibility for any loss of data, damages, or consequences arising from the use of our service. This includes, but is not limited to, any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use the service, unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data, or any other matter relating to the service.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge that the use of our service is at your own risk, and we shall not be liable for any damages or losses incurred as a result of using the service.</p>

    <h2 id="s.1">1. Individual Use Only</h2>

    <p>Our file upload system is designed for individual users to securely share files for personal and <a style="color: cornflowerblue;" href="#s.2">legitimate purposes</a>. </p>
    <p>Commercial or advertising-related activities are not permitted unless prior authorization is obtained from us.</p>

    <p>If we suspect that content uploaded to our platform is intended for commercial or advertising purposes rather
        than individual use, we reserve the right to take appropriate action, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul class="dotted-list">
        <li>Blocking the IP address associated with the upload.</li>
        <li>Removing the content from our system.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Additionally, we may initiate an investigation into the uploaded content. As part of this investigation, we may
        review the file being sent and its intended use. Based on our findings, we may take one of the following
        actions:</p>
    <ul class="dotted-list">
        <li>Blocking the IP address and removing the file.</li>
        <li>Blocking the IP address without removing the file.</li>
        <li>Removing the file without blocking the IP address.</li>
        <li>Taking no action if the content is deemed to comply with our guidelines.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>It is important for users to ensure that the content they upload is for personal use and complies with our terms
        of service. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding in maintaining a fair and secure environment for
        all users.</p>


    <h2 id="s.2">2. Prohibited Content</h2>

    <p>Our file upload system is intended for the secure and lawful sharing of files for personal and legitimate
        purposes. As such, the following types of content are strictly prohibited:</p>
    <ul class="dotted-list">
        <li>Any content that violates local, state, national, or international laws or regulations.</li>
        <li>Content that infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others, including but not limited to
            copyrights, trademarks, and patents.</li>
        <li>Material that promotes or contains illegal activities, including but not limited to the distribution of
            malware, viruses, or other harmful software.</li>
        <li>Content that is defamatory, obscene, pornographic, or otherwise offensive or inappropriate.</li>
        <li>Files that contain sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, or
            other confidential data, without proper authorization.</li>
        <li>Any content that encourages or facilitates illegal activities or promotes violence, discrimination, or hate
            speech.</li>
        <li>Material that is intended to harass, intimidate, or threaten others.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <p>Furthermore, users are prohibited from uploading any content that may cause harm, damage, or disruption to our
        systems, network, or other users' devices. This includes, but is not limited to, files containing malicious
        code, viruses, or other harmful software.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to remove any content that violates these guidelines and to take appropriate action,
        including suspending or terminating access to our services, in cases of repeated violations. Additionally, we
        may report illegal activities to the relevant authorities as required by law.</p>
    <p>It is the responsibility of users to ensure that the content they upload complies with these guidelines and all
        applicable laws and regulations. We encourage users to report any violations or concerns to us promptly.</p>

    <h2 id="s.3">3. IP Collection</h2>

    <p>To ensure compliance with our Terms of Service and to prevent misuse of our file upload system, we may collect

        legal purposes, including but not limited to investigating and preventing unauthorized access, abuse, or illegal
        activities.</p>
    <p>Additionally, to maintain the integrity of our system, IP addresses may be retained for a period of up to one
        year after the respective file has been removed from our servers. This retention period allows us to address any
        potential legal issues or disputes that may arise regarding uploaded content.</p>
    <p>Rest assured that your IP address is safe with us and will not be disclosed to the public or law enforcement
        authorities unless required by a valid court order or legal process. We are committed to protecting the privacy

    <h3 id="s.3.1">3.1 IP Retention Duration</h3>

As such, we want to clarify that your IP address will be held for as long as the corresponding content remains on our servers, in addition to the one-year retention period mentioned earlier.</p>
    <p>This means that if you upload content to our platform, your IP address will be securely stored alongside the content for the duration of its presence on our servers, plus an additional one-year period thereafter. Our commitment to protecting your privacy remains unwavering, and we adhere to stringent security measures to ensure the confidentiality of your information at all times.</p>

This policy is in place to mitigate the risk of unauthorized or malicious activities that could compromise the security of our platform or violate our terms of service.</p>
    <p>Please be advised that any requests originating from VPNs or proxies may be denied, and users attempting to access our service through these means may be subject to further investigation. This measure is implemented to protect both our platform and our users from potential legal ramifications associated with the upload of prohibited or infringing content.</p>
    <p>We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to this policy, as it allows us to maintain a secure and trustworthy environment for all users.
